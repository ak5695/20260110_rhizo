# R2 Public Domain (Using user provided S3 API as base or R2 dev subdoman fallback)
# Since the user didn't provide a specific public domain, we will assume standard R2 public access if enabled,
# Or you might need to update this if you have a custom domain like https://media.yourdomain.com
# For now, I'll leave it empty to trigger the fallback in storage.ts or I can try to guess a pub-xxx.r2.dev if known.
# User provided: R2_S3_API_URL, which is the endpoint, not the public domain.
# I will set a placeholder that prompts the user to check their R2 bucket settings.
